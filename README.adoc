= Spin

Spin provides an adaptor between your (Clojure) code and the 'resource
interface' of the web.

Spin implements all of HTTP (RFCs 7230-7235) as faithfully as possible.

You provide the code that satisfies Spin's protocols. In exchange, you get a
runtime that fully conforms with HTTP.

== Status

Spin is still under active development and is ALPHA status, meaning that the API
should be considered unstable and likely to change.

It is planned that Spin will be agnostic as to whether you are using Ring's sync
(1-arity) of async (3-arity) forms and will support both. Currently, only the
3-arity form is supported.

== Relationship to other Clojure libraries

Spin is the successor to yada, JUXT's HTTP library.

Spin asks you to 'bring your own router', and so can be used with Compojure,
bidi, Reitit and other Clojure routing libraries.
