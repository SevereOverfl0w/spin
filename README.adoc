= Spin

The sophistication of the HTTP protocol means it just isn't possible to expect
that its laws and proscriptions to be followed with any precision without a
higher-level orchestrator. That's what Spin provides.

Think of Spin as a kernel designed to handle web requests. This kernel calls out
to code in 'user space' for anything it needs from the application to handle the
request on its behalf.

You provide the code that satisfies Spin's protocols. In exchange, you get a
runtime that fully conforms with HTTP.

== But why is it called Spin?

The name 'spin' is a deliberate pun on the word 'web'. A spider spinning its web
is a very intricate affair, and so is reacting to an HTTP request!

== Relevant Standards

Spin implements RFCs 7231-7235 as faithfully as possible.

== Status

Spin is still under active development and is ALPHA status, meaning that the API
should be considered unstable and likely to change.

It is planned that Spin will be agnostic as to whether you are using Ring's sync
(1-arity) of async (3-arity) forms and will support both. Currently, only the
3-arity form is supported.

== Relationship to other Clojure libraries

Spin is hoped to be an official successor to https://github.com/juxt/yada.

Spin is independent of routing and treats URIs as opaque. This lets you 'bring
your own router', and so can be used with Compojure, bidi, Reitit and other
Clojure routing libraries.

== Features

TBD.
