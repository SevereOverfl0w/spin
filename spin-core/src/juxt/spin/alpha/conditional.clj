;; From RFC 7232:
;; "(an) origin server MUST evaluate received request preconditions after it has
;; successfully performed its normal request checks and just before it would
;; perform the action associated with the request method.  A server MUST ignore
;; all received preconditions if its response to the same request without those
;; conditions would have been a status code other than a 2xx (Successful) or 412
;; (Precondition Failed).  In other words, redirects and failures take
;; precedence over the evaluation of preconditions in conditional requests. "
